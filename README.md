# Graduation Internship Prototype
### Context
As part of my graduation internship, I developed a prototype to gamify an existing animal tracking application. This GitHub repository is a clone of the current production version, with the newly developed gamification features integrated.

### Gamification
The following game elements have been added to improve user engagement:

- **Visual Login Streak**: Rewards users for consecutive daily logins.
- **Achievement Badges**: Visual badges that showcase player milestones and accomplishments.
- **Mini-Games**: Small interactive games designed to make the experience more fun and rewarding.

### Gitmoji
For this project, I used [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) â€” an emoji guide for commit messages. It helps provide a quick, visual overview of the purpose of each commit.
